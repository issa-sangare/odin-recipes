            <h2>Roast Spatchcock Turkey</h2>
            <p>When you spatchcock a turkey you get the juiciest, crispiest roast turkey cooked in a fraction of the time it usually takes to cook a whole turkey. If you've never tried it, spatchcocking is easier than you might think! By removing the backbone and flattening out the bird, you'll reduce cooking time and make carving a whole lot easier, too! Once you try it, you might never go back.</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a roasting rack on a baking sheet.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Place turkey, breast-side down, on a cutting board. Using a pair of sharp heavy-duty kitchen shears, cut along one side of the backbone.</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Repeat on the other side of the backbone. Remove backbone and reserve for making turkey stock for gravy.</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Press firmly down onto both sides of turkey to flatten.</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Flip turkey breast-side up and put on the roasting rack. Tuck wing tips under turkey (behind breast). Pat skin dry and rub olive oil over entire turkey. Season with sage, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes, rotating the baking sheet every 30 minutes.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and continue to roast until skin is crisp and golden, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
